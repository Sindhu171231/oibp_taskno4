An email spam classifier uses machine learning to identify and filter out spam emails from legitimate ones. It is trained on labeled datasets featuring email content and metadata. Common algorithms include Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, and Decision Trees. Performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Once trained, the classifier integrates into email systems for automatic filtering. Key challenges include evolving spam tactics and handling imbalanced datasets.
